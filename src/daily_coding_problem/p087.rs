A NE B

This means this means point `A` is located northeast of point `B`.

A SW C
```

means that point `A` is southwest of `C`.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

```
A N B
B NE C
C N A
```

does not validate, since `A` cannot be both north and south of `C`.

```
A NW B
A N B
```
